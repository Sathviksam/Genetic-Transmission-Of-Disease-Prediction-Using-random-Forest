# Genetic-Transmission-Of-Disease-Prediction-Using-random-Forest
This project uses a Random Forest classification model to predict the likelihood of genetic disease transmission based on genomic and clinical features. It leverages machine learning to assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment for inherited disorders.
# ðŸ§¬ Genetic Transmission of Disease Prediction Using Random Forest

This project aims to predict the transmission of genetic diseases using machine learning, specifically the **Random Forest** classification algorithm. It uses genomic and clinical features to classify whether a genetic disorder may be inherited, helping in early diagnosis and preventive care.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Genetic disorders are often inherited and can be predicted based on genome sequences and other clinical parameters. This project builds a Random Forest classifier to:
- Identify risk factors for transmission
- Predict whether a genetic disorder will be passed on
- Assist genetic counselors and healthcare professionals

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- Genetic profiles
- Family history
- Clinical and demographic features
- Target labels: types or risk level of genetic disorders

> Dataset Source: *[Specify if from Kaggle or any other source]*

## ðŸ§  Model and Approach

We use the **Random Forest** algorithm due to its:
- High accuracy
- Robustness against overfitting
- Ability to handle both numeri
Steps followed:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Model training with hyperparameter tuning
4. Model evaluation with test data
5. Flask API integration for prediction
